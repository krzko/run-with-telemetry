name: Run with Telemetry

description: >
  Execute a command on the runner and export the associated OpenTelemetry
  trace. This action is cross-platform compatible across Linux, macOS, and Windows.
  It is designed to work optimally with the OpenTelemetry Collector,
  GitHub Actions Event Receiver, aligning the telemetry within steps to what
  the receiver emits. This action also injects OTEL-* environment variables
  into the shell, enabling further configuration of the OpenTelemetry
  instrumentation.
